# CDF combat regulations draft, 28MAY22.

## 1: The big ones
- No griefing, doxing, stalking, harassing or otherwise negatively impact the group, individuals or simulator.
- No hatespeech / slurs.
- No copybotting or imitating equipment of the group nor its assets.
- No entitlement or demands. You don’t own nor run this group or simulator.

## 2: Common combat regulations
- First and foremost, if we deem something to be detrimental to the flow of combat, we reserve the right to deny it for the duration of combat, or potentially longer.
- The ratio for combat is 1:1.5 in either direction unless otherwise is agreed upon.
- Do not wireframe, use ARC/ARW, Collision skeletons, hitboxes or other irregular viewer features to try and gain an unfair advantage. Firestorm’s combat feature is acceptable.
- There is no definitive height restriction, provided such **isn't abused.** It will be judged on case-by-case basis.
- Dodgerolls should take you no further than 10 meters and may not function in midair.
- Do not use grapplehooks, breachcharges or any other movement enhancers, teleporters or medic-TPs.
- No obnoxious sound or light spam.
- Do not loiter during or after combat without the Fleet Admiral's permission.
- Do not do raid interception on other militaries.
- We reserve the right to fully enforce as well as make exemptions to the above stated regulations.

## 3: Communications courtesy
- This sim and group houses members from other militaries and unaffiliated groups and communities. Please treat others with respect and keep the out-of-combat axe grinding for elsewhere, be it on voice, inworld voice, chat or IMs.
- The OIC (Officer in Command) is responsible for the forces attacking / defending, be they members of the group, militia or lonewolves fighting alongside attackers or defenders.
- When entering with intent to raid, declare an OIC and await response. This can be done to one of the members active on base.
- During combat, please act professional. If you act as if you believe you have the power to dictate what we should do, you will be asked to stop or find someone else to take over. Same goes for acting like a manchild.
- Violations will be noted and approached in the following order depending on continuation and/or severity:
1. A warning
2. Full Force Response
3. Ejection
4. 24 hour ban
5. 7 day ban
6. Permanent ban

## 4: The battlefield
- The spawn parcels are completely off limits. Attempted intentional blackscreening will be dealt with accordingly.
- The attackers spawn sports a yellow zone and a red zone. The yellow zone is the deployment zone for vehicles and is considered generally safe. We will shoot into that zone in case you choose to have deployables there. The red zone is your spawn zone and you will not be under fire there unless you have been actively engaging from there.
- The objectives in play function as points for teleportation to advance your foothold on the field. These will be turned on during combat, but it can be requested that these should not be used. Should you encounter an issue with the objectives, please notify Exavier Lupindo immediately with screenshots and a description of the issue.

## 5: Deployables and mines
- All deployables should have a proper LBA description and are limited to LBA Light / Slim. These should not be placed inside the spawnrooms.
- Barricades of standard size should not exceed 200HP, sit barrades at 100HP, heavy barricades / walls at 550HP as maximum.
- Barricades and walls may NOT be placed inside buildings, tunnels or objective points. 
- Mines must have a LBA-Light /Slim description, maximum 1HP and should be disabled / detonated with normal collisions as well. Planted C4 charges may have 5HP but should be able to be disarmed without obstruction by click-hold.
- No automated turrets, drones or NPCs in any capacity. Remotecontrolled drones can be used (One per combatant).
- Interceptors should have no more than 10 charges with at least a 10 second recharge time when depleted, and may not have more than 25HP LBA-Light or Slim.

## 6: Munitions
- Maximum radius for explosives is 5 meters for infantry, 10 meters for vehicle main munitions. The cooldown timer is 5 seconds for infantry, 3 seconds for vehicles. All munitions should be raycasted and may NOT spall (Penetrate hard surfaces).
- Maximum AT output of an infantryman should not exceed 75 (50?) and 100 for vehicles.
- No invisible, phantom or seeking bullets. Semitransparent bullets are fine.
- Do not use Agentlist guns, nor full auto raycast.
- Flak / proximity detonated nonguided munitions may only be fired from a vehicle or armored emplacement, and is only allowed to be used against aircraft.
- Lingering effects may not last longer than 30 seconds, and may not have a permanent effect on infantry / physgriefing of vehicles. The effects may not kill immediately either if lingering and may not spread to other combatants.
- Munitions should not be loud/obnoxious of nature. If in doubt, contact Exavier Lupindo to get a verdict.

## 7: Vehicles and armor values

### Final statement:
- The OIC and or the Admiral reserves the right to at all times enforce or exempt the rules above in order to make the combat experience as fun and involving to all combatants as deemed necessary. Any issues with a decision made during the combat scenario can be brought to Exavier Lupindo **after** combat has concluded, and no more than 48 hours after the conclusion of the combat instance. The decision made by Exavier Lupindo will then be the final say in the matter and should not be pursued further.
